# tw5-monaco

Supercharged code and text editor component using the excellent [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) \- the editor that powers [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The integration is very basic right now. See below.

Inspired by the [CodeMirror](#CodeMirror) plugin. Monaco Editor is licensed under MIT, copyright Microsoft. 

## Disclaimer

This is very alpha-level code for now, so no guarantee that it will not delete all your text and tiddlers randomly, brick and/or otherwise corrupt your installation.

Of course I don't expect that to happen and for what it's worth, I wrote this readme with it, so it seems to work alright for what it is.

## Features

A lot of the out-of-the-box features of Monaco already work well. This includes syntax highlighting for select languages (HTML, JS, Markdown), advanced multiselections and editing, scrollbar minimap, word and language autocompletion, etc.

## Limitations

* **Online only**. The Monaco editor source itself will be loaded remotely from `unpkg.com`, so editing while offline isn't possible at this point.
* **No wikitext syntax highlighting**. Monaco does not support this by default, but I'm hoping being able to integrate directly with the [TiddlyWiki](#TiddlyWiki) parser would be interesting.
* **No configuration**. Yet?
