This is a live example of the Monaco editor in action!

Feel free to try it out in this markdown tiddler.

## Why a markdown tiddler?

As you can see, Monaco already supports it as a language **by default**, so it makes for a _good demo_.

As part of the markdown language support, links like https://tiddlywiki.com are automatically highlighted and linked.

See [readme](#$:/plugins/smilyorg/monaco/readme) below for more details.
